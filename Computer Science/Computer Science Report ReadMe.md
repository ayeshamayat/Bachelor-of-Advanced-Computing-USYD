### Abstract
This report details the nature, content, career path and future possibilities for the Computer Science major, one of the four majors offered by the Advanced Computing degree. In particular, it contrasts the unique nature and some of the commonalities of the Computer Science major compared to the other majors (although it is best read in conjuction with the reports on those majors). Ultimately, this report aims to illuminate to potential Advanced Computing students the nature of the computer science major, so that they can better informed in their decesions when making a choice of major.

### Summary of findings
##### *Nature of the Computer Science Major*
The Computer Science major has a uniquely strong focus on the theoretical study of computing, both as an abstract concept and with regards to its application with software. For example, Computer science majors study the design and analysis of algorithms, abstract representations of computing (e.g. Turing Machines / Lambda calculus) and the fundamental design of computers at a near-hardware level. In summary computer science focuses on the study of computers as a concept in and of themselves, in contrast with other majors that focus on applying computing principles to problems such as the analysis of data or the development of software, making computer science as a major suited to students who are interested in the theory of computing.

##### *Future possibilities for computer science major graduates*
Due to the accelerating digitization of our modern world, the possibilities for all majors of advanced computing are growing and changing in rapid and unpredictable ways. In particular, the growing potential of technologies such as Artifical Intelligence and Quantum computing, alongside the increasing application and study of existing fields such as cryptography and cyber security, provides a near-endless source of future possibilities for computer science majors. Graduates could find themselves in any part of the IT sector, and many jobs outside of it, although the problem-solving and abstract thinking skills gained during the major make graduates particularly well suited for jobs such as a software engineer, cyber security analyst, academic, machine learning enginner, consultant, and many more.
