Finally, the progression and future of this industry are discussed.

### Summary of findings
##### *Nature of the Computational Data Science Major*
The Computational Data Science has a strong focus on data itself. The major teaches the essentials to be able to retrieve, manage, process, and analyse data as well as the soft skills to complement them. This is all with the aim of providing data-driven decisions and predictive analysis. These skills are valuable in all areas of industry with the growth of the Internet of Things and more businesses becoming connected to the internet and seeking to improve through the use of technology. There also exists a wide range of job opportunities working with purely the data itself, to a more client-based approach and even in areas of artificial intelligence collaborating with professioinals in all other IT fields.

##### *Future possibilities for computational data science major graduates*

The future of data scientists is in developing the advancing technical world by providing data-driven decisions and predictive analysis to problems. In particular, this can be in the field of business and artificial intelligence where more and more processes are being automated by smart devices. A data scientists' future lies in developing skills that will not be overtaken by automation and AI systems. Graduates will develop skills to ask key questions for data analysis and creative thinking for data-driven solutions.
