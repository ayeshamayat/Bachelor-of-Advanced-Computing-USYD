# Team KAT

## Project description
Team KAT is a written report on the Bachelor of Advanced Computing, focusing on three of its four majors: Software Development, Computational Data Science and Computer Science. This report is helpful for aspiring computer scientists interested in the career opportunities of each of the majors in the Bachelor of Advanced Computing. 
The topics include an overview of each major, timeline and courses of the major, its expected career paths and emerging possibilities in the field.

## Background
As the potential offered by computers has grown and developed over the last few decades, the depth and technical detail within individual aspects of the IT sphere has greatly increased, resultingly in the growing need for specialisation within IT. Specifically, IT has split into four main areas: The study and analysis of data, the practices and techniques of developing software, the theoretical foundations of computing and the study of the information systems that result from computing solutions. This is reflected in the split of the Advanced Computing degree into four similar, but distinctly unique, majors. An understanding of the nature of and the differences between these majors is necessary for future computing students to study and learn the material that is most relevant to them.
