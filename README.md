# Team KAT

## Project description
Team KAT is a written report on the Bachelor of Advanced Computing, focusing on three of its four majors: Software Development, Computational Data Science and Computer Science. This report is helpful for aspiring computer scientists interested in the career opportunities of each of the majors in the Bachelor of Advanced Computing. 
The topics include an overview of each major, timeline and courses of the major, its expected career paths and emerging possibilities in the field.

## Background
As the potential offered by computers has grown and developed over the last few decades, the depth and technical detail within individual aspects of the IT sphere has greatly increased, resultingly in the growing need for specialisation within IT. Specifically, IT has split into four main areas: The study and analysis of data, the practices and techniques of developing software, the theoretical foundations of computing and the study of the information systems that result from computing solutions. This is reflected in the split of the Advanced Computing degree into four similar, but distinctly unique, majors. An understanding of the nature of and the differences between these majors is necessary for future computing students to study and learn the material that is most relevant to them.

## Summary of findings
The Advanced Computing majors offer a diverse and varied set of skills and techniques, providing the ability for students to specialise in areas they find the most interesting. All majors develop a strong computational base, with the study of basic and intermediate programming, and the development of common soft skills such as teamwork and communication. Subsequent study however becomes progressively more specialised as the major core and electives gain promenance. The software development major focuses on the practices and techniques relevant to software development, such as project management, team organisation, and programming problem solving in a software development context. Contrastingly, the computational data science major develops a stronger focus on the analysis and interpretation of data, and drawing novel conclusions from such data. Finally, the computer science major focuses on the theoretical fundamentals of computing, such as algorithmic design and analysis.

Graduates of all of these majors have a diverse range of possible careers in the IT industry, however the major's specialisations favor particular roles for certain graduates over others. Computational data science graduates may find themselves working anywhere from business analystics to artifical-intelligence, powering data-driven decesions. Software development major graduates see some overlap, able to work on the programming behind Artifical Intelligence, but may also work in new areas such as Virtual Reality. Computer Scientists may work on anything from quantum computers, to new cryptographic methods, to academic research and the fundamental nature and limitations of computing. Finally, through the combination of the technical problem-solving skills and the softer communication and abstract thinking skills gained by all advanced computing graduates, jobs outside of the IT sector such as consulting, or bussiness analysts are similarly available.
