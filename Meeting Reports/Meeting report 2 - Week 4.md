Meeting 2 report: Week 4
=========================

### Progress made this week
* Completed some research regarding the overview of the major and its timeline and courses.
* Correctly connected our Overleaf page to GitHub via USYD.

### Progress goals for next meeting
* Research the types of roles that are available for the majors and the skills needed to be successful in them. Go into some detail.

### Problems encountered since last meeting
Some members were behind in their research. This was not an issue as the research is individual and not yet reliant on one another. It will be completed along with the next progress goals.
