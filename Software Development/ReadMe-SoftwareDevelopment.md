### *Abstract*
This report covers the Nature of the Software Development major as well as the future possibilities for Software Development graduates. Software Development is one of the four majors of the Bachelor of Advanced Computing and this report summurises the similarites and differences that Software Development shares with the other majors. The aim of the report is to guide aspiring partakers of Software Development as well as provide them with insight of the course so that they will be able to better understand and know what to expect form the major.


### Summary of findings
##### *Nature of the Software Development Major*
Software Development is the study and research of how basic software systems are constructed. Partakers of Software Development are expected to be able to design, program, document,run the program as well as test for bugs within the software and applications and thus aspiring Software Developers will have to have basic skills and knowledge of Project management, quality assurance testing as well as software design in order to be able to work on a Software project. In comparison to other majors, Software development has a more "Hands-on" approach as mainly focuses on applying concepts from other majors like Computer Science, such as computation theory and computation principles, in order to solve a problem or issue and adheres to the clients' needs.

#### *Future possibilities for Software Development Major graduates*

As technology in the modern world advances and improves, many new possibilities have emerged. An emerging possibility is the use of Programming Assistants.Programming assistants use A.I to help coders by giving autosuggestions of code, such as syntax as well as function signatures that A.I predict the coders may program with. The use of programming assistants may help QA analysts reduce the number of potential bugs and errors found in code and potentially decrease the time taken to fix it. Another example is the utilisation of Virtual Reality as it gives many possibilities of 3D models and diagrams based of blueprint of Software Architecture. Virtual Reality gives way to many recreational activites such as gaming and simulations as well as being used to view and see designs of architecture. Such possibilites will enable Software Development graduates to utillise their programming skills, abstract skills as well as problem skills and apply them to their future jobs in the I.t Industry.
